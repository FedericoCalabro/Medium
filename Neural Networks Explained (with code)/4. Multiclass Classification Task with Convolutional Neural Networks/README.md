# Multiclass Classification Task with Convolutional Neural Networks
Handwritten Digits Recognition

## Introduction
Computers, unlike humans, lack physical eyes, yet they possess remarkable vision capabilities. How? Through artificial neural networks! Welcome to the second practical installment of our ANN series. In this article, we’ll explore convolutional neural networks (CNNs), their applications, potentials, and limitations. We’ll then delve into building an ANN tasked with recognizing handwritten digits.
