# Time Series Forecasting Task with Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM)
Stockâ€™s price predictions ðŸ“ˆ

## Introduction
Have you ever wondered if networks can actually retain information? Well, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) do precisely that. Specifically, weâ€™ll be utilizing Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a subset of RNNs, to analyze sequential stock price data. By leveraging past values, we aim to predict future trends. Contrary to magic, predicting the future is a skill you can acquire too.
