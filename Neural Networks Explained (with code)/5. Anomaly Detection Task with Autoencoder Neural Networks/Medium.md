# Anomaly Detection Task with Autoencoder Neural Networks
Electrocardiogram Anomalies Recognition

## Introduction
Ever pondered the extent to which data can be compressed? Well, it varies, depending on the type of data. Autoencoders accomplish this task through a fascinating process, though it’s not magic; there’s math behind it. In this article, we’ll delve into how autoencoders function, forming the foundation for more advanced architectures. Additionally, we’ll apply them practically to recognize anomalous electrocardiograms.
