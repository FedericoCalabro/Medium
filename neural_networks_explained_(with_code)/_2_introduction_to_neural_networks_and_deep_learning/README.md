# Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks

Its not that hard! ðŸ’ª

## Introduction

In this article, weâ€™ll delve deeper into the mechanisms of machine learning. First, weâ€™ll introduce the concept of deep learning (DL). Then, weâ€™ll explore artificial neural networks (ANNs) in detail, examining how they operate and identifying key foundational ANNs from which others derive. In upcoming articles, weâ€™ll provide practical code examples for building each of the afore mentioned key ANN to solve real-world problems.
