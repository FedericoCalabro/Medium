# Regression Task with Feedforward Neural Networks

Health Insurance Charge Prediction

## Introduction

This is the first real practical article of the series about Artificial Neural Networks hence we are going to keep it very simple and easy to follow. We are going to use ANNsâ€™s power to predict how much a person will be charged for its health insurance by giving the net some parameters in input. The prediction of a numeric value out of an algorithm is called regression. In this case we are going to use a feedforward neural networks for this purpose.
