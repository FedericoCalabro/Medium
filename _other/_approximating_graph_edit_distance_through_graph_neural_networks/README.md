# Approximating Graph Edit Distance through Graph Neural Networks

My Masterâ€™s Thesis in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science

## Introduction

At 19, I began my Computer Science journey at university. Just a year later, I started working as a full-stack developer at my current company. By the time I graduated at 21, I had gained significant experience, and over the next two years, I transitioned into a role as a data engineer, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. This article highlights the key aspects of my thesis, which is publicly available on GitHub for further exploration.
