# Iterator Design Pattern Explained

Navigate data-structures forÂ ðŸ†“

The Iterator design pattern is a behavioral pattern that provides a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. This pattern is particularly useful for traversing complex data structures in a consistent manner. In this article, we'll explore how the Iterator pattern can be used to navigate through a collection of books, enabling clients to iterate through the collection without needing to understand its internal structure. Let's see a practical example to understand the implementation of this pattern.
