# Prototype Design Pattern Explained

Clone your objects the right way!Â ðŸ§¬

## Introduction

The Prototype design pattern is a creational pattern that allows for the creation of new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern is particularly useful when the cost of creating a new instance is high, or when the configuration of the new instance is complex. By cloning a prototype, we can efficiently create new objects with the same state as the prototype. In this article, we will explore the Prototype pattern with a practical example using a Shape abstract class and its concrete implementations. This example will demonstrate how to use cloning to streamline the creation of complex objects in your applications.
