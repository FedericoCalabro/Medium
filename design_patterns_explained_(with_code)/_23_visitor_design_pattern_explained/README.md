# Visitor Design Pattern Explained

Maintenance in theÂ ðŸŒŒ

## Introduction

The Visitor design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows you to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying their classes. It achieves this by letting you define a new operation in a separate class (the visitor) and applying it to objects of the original classes. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with complex object structures that might need different kinds of operations. In this article, weâ€™ll explore how the Visitor pattern can be used to perform maintenance on various spacecraft components, such as the engine, solar panels, and control systems, by using a repair robot.
