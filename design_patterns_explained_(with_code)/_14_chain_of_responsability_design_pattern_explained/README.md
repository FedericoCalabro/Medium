# Chain of Responsability Design Pattern Explained

An handler for every occasion!

## Introduction

The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows a request to be passed along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain. This pattern is particularly useful for decoupling the sender of a request from its receivers, allowing multiple objects to handle the request without the sender needing to know which object will handle it. In this article, we'll explore how the Chain of Responsibility pattern can be applied to a purchase approval system, where different levels of management approve purchase requests based on their authority. Let's dive into a practical example to understand the implementation of this pattern.
