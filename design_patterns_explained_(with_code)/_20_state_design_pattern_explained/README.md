# State Design Pattern Explained

Traffic Light Controller ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´

## Introduction

The State design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful when an object must change its behavior depending on its current state, making the code easier to maintain and extend. In this article, we'll explore how the State pattern can be applied to a traffic light controller, which changes its behavior as it cycles through different states (Red, Green, Yellow). By using the State pattern, we can encapsulate the traffic light's states and transitions, making the controller more modular and flexible.
