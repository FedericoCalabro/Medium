Adapter Design Pattern Explained
Legacy code? NoÂ problem!

## Introduction
The Adapter design pattern is a structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, enabling them to communicate and interact seamlessly. This pattern is particularly useful when integrating legacy components (which is very common) into new systems or working with third-party libraries. In this article, we'll explore how the Adapter pattern can be applied to adapt an old printing system (hope you never have to deal with them) to work with a new one, ensuring compatibility without altering the existing code. Let's see a practical example to understand how this pattern can be implemented effectively.
