# Facade Design Pattern Explained

Pc hardware management can be easy!

## Introduction

The Facade design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use. This pattern is useful for reducing the complexity of client interactions with subsystems by offering a higher-level interface. In this article, we’ll explore how the Facade pattern can be used to simplify the interaction with a computer system, by providing a single interface to start and shut down the computer. Let’s see how this pattern can be practically applied with a detailed example.
