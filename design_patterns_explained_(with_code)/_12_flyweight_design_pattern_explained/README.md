Flyweight Design Pattern Explained
RAM consumption optimization

## Introduction
The Flyweight design pattern is a structural pattern used to minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. This pattern is particularly useful when working with a large number of objects that share common properties. In this article, we'll explore how the Flyweight pattern can optimize memory consumption in a forest management system by sharing tree type data among multiple tree instances. Let's dive into a practical example to understand the implementation of this pattern.
