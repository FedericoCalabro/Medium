# Template_method Design Pattern Explained

Streamline a Process with Customizability

## Introduction

The Template Method design pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to override specific steps without changing the algorithm's structure. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to define the overall structure of a process while letting subclasses customize certain steps. In this article, weâ€™ll explore how the Template Method pattern can be applied to baking cakes, with different types of cakes (e.g., Chocolate Cake and Vanilla Cake) following a common baking process. We'll see how this pattern promotes code reuse and flexibility by adhering to a consistent template.
