# Composite Design Pattern Explained

Need a ðŸŒ² representation? Here itÂ is

## Introduction

The Composite design pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, making it useful for working with complex tree structures. In this article, we'll explore how the Composite pattern can be applied to manage a file system hierarchy, where files and directories are treated as individual components and composites respectively. Let's dive into a practical example to understand the implementation of this pattern.
